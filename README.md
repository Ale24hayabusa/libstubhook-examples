# libstubhook examples #

The following mods are all for the app Minecraft: Pocket Edition.
I will try to add examples for other apps later.

===

## *Made by me* ##

## sandgravel.c ##
Makes pillars of sand and gravel when one of these blocks is
placed. Heavily commented, so this serves as a good starting
point for beginners.

## instareactor.c ##
Causes the nether reactor pattern to be built around the core when
one is placed.

## explosivearrow.c ##
Makes arrows explode on impact. Uses instance and code state
tracking within the code.

## harderzombies.c ##
Zombies move twice as fast and are invincible. Shows off basic
usage of `SHPtrHook`, a very powerful feature mainly used for
hooking C++ virtual methods.
