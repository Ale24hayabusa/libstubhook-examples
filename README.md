# libstubhook examples #

The following mods are all for the app Minecraft: Pocket Edition.
I will try to add examples for other apps later.

## explosivearrow.c ##
Makes arrows explode on impact.

## instareactor.c ##
Causes the nether reactor pattern to be built around the core when
one is placed.

## sandgravel.c ##
Makes pillars of sand and gravel when one of these blocks is
placed. **This should be the first mod beginners look at, since
it contains lots of very helpful comments.**
