# libstubhook examples #

The following mods are all for the app Minecraft: Pocket Edition.
I will try to add examples for other apps later. You may use this
code and redistribute binary versions as long as you make it clear
that I am the author of these mods.

## *Made by me* ##

## sandgravel.c ##
Makes pillars of sand and gravel when one of these blocks is
placed. Heavily commented, so this serves as a good starting
point for beginners.

## instareactor.c ##
Causes the nether reactor pattern to be built around the core when
one is placed.

## explosivearrow.c ##
Makes arrows explode on impact. Uses instance and code state
tracking within the code.

## harderzombies.c ##
Zombies move twice as fast and are invincible. Shows off basic
usage of `SHPtrHook`, a very powerful feature mainly used for
hooking C++ virtual methods.

## flyinsurvival.c ##
Allows the player to fly in survival mode without side effects
such as making the player invincible. The player can obviously fly
and cannot be hurt by falling. All other forms of damage still
apply.
